## Implementation in Gigalearn

### C++ Integration

To use these rewards in Gigalearn, add the desired reward class to your `commonrewards.h` file:

```cpp
#include "rewards/event/EventReward/reward.cpp"
#include "rewards/velocity/SpeedReward/reward.cpp"
#include "rewards/touch/TouchBallReward/reward.cpp"
// Add more rewards as needed
```

### Python Integration

For Python-based training, import the reward classes directly:

```python
from rewards.event.EventReward.reward import EventReward
from rewards.velocity.SpeedReward.reward import SpeedReward
from rewards.touch.TouchBallReward.reward import TouchBallReward
# Add more rewards as needed
```

### Combining Rewards

Both C++ and Python versions support reward combination:

**C++ Example:**
```cpp
// Create combined reward system
auto eventReward = std::make_unique<EventReward>(1.0f, 0.5f, -1.0f, 0.1f);
auto speedReward = std::make_unique<SpeedReward>();
auto touchReward = std::make_unique<TouchBallReward>(0.2f);
```

**Python Example:**
```python
from rlgym.utils.reward_functions import CombinedReward

combined_reward = CombinedReward([
    EventReward(goal=1.0, team_goal=0.5, concede=-1.0, touch=0.1),
    SpeedReward(),
    TouchBallReward(0.2)
])
```

## Reward Architecture

### C++ Structure
Each C++ reward inherits from the base `Reward` class and implements:
- `GetReward(const Player& player, const GameState& state, bool isFinal)` - Main reward calculation
- `Reset(const GameState& initialState)` - State reset functionality

### Python Structure
Each Python reward inherits from `RewardFunction` and implements:
- `get_reward(player, state, previous_action)` - Main reward calculation
- `reset(initial_state)` - State reset functionality

## File Organization

```
rewards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event/          # Event-based rewards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ velocity/       # Movement and speed rewards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ touch/          # Ball interaction rewards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aerial/         # Aerial maneuver rewards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ball/           # Ball control and positioning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ positioning/    # Strategic positioning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ control/        # Car control and mechanics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utility/        # Helper and wrapper rewards
```

Each reward directory contains:
- `reward.cpp` - C++ implementation
- `reward.py` - Python implementation

## Usage Recommendations

### For Beginners
Start with these essential rewards:
1. **SpeedReward** - Basic movement training
2. **TouchBallReward** - Ball interaction
3. **EventReward** - Game event awareness

### For Intermediate Training
Add complexity with:
1. **VelocityPlayerToBallReward** - Ball chasing
2. **PositioningReward** - Strategic positioning
3. **BoostDiscipline** - Resource management

### For Advanced Training
Include specialized rewards:
1. **AerialNavigation** - Aerial mechanics
2. **ThreeManRewards** - Team coordination
3. **SequentialRewards** - Complex behavior chains

## Customization

All rewards are designed to be easily customizable through constructor parameters. Modify reward weights, thresholds, and behaviors by adjusting the initialization parameters to suit your specific training needs.

## Contributing

This reward collection is designed to be modular and extensible. Each reward is self-contained and can be used independently or combined with others to create complex training scenarios.
